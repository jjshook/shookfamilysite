<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Mary Ann (Pate) Hormuth has been researching the Pate family for decades. As part of her research,
Mary Ann placed two pictures in the Pate Family folder in the Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas genealogy
libary. One of these pictures (the &quot;porch&quot; picture) has Tassie (Pate) Shook (my g-grandmother), 
in it. I recently had a long, wonderful chat with Mary Ann on a fine Sunday afternoon (19-OCT-2014).
After many emails, it was nice to talk with her.</p>
