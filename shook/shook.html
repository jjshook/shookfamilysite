<p>I began this web site to document my Shook family. As the research grew,
I began documenting other Shook families as a way to separate my family from
others. It wasn't long when I found researching other Shook families was just
as enjoyable. Today, about 60% of this research is on my Shook family: Johannes
Georg Schuck, der Elder (John George Shook, Sr.), while the other 40% relates
to other Shook families. So while this web site began about my family, it has
evolved into a broader Shook Family web site.</p>

<h1>Scope of Research</h1>

<p>This research began with my family in Texas following those ancestors back
to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Germany. As mentioned above, in researching
my family I have been identifying other Shook families too. Most of this research is
very methodical. I have recorded all Shook individuals identified in findagrave.com,
for example, in Texas and Louisana, and I'm working on Oklahoma and Alabama --
basically states bordering Texas and the migration of my family from North Carolina
and Pennsylvania. I have also documented all the Shook individuals with a death
certificate in Texas.</p>

<h1>The Shook Name</h1>

<p>The name Shook is the anglicized variant of German Schuck. My family ancestor,
for example, was Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder. In English, his name is John George
Shook, Sr. After the second generation or so, German Schuck becomes English Shook.</p>

<h1>Shook Family Lines</h1>

<p>The index at the right lists all the Shook individuals I have profiled.</p>

<p>The family lines I am profiling are listed below with a link to Ancestry.com
to that family tree. If you have an Ancestry.com account, this may be helpful in your
research as I tend to have more information on the maternal side on Ancestry.com.</p>

<p>Currently, about 700 Shook individuals have been profiled. The master index is to the right,
and this is the only page with the master index. So come back to this page for the list of all Shook
individuals. Note that profiling means a web page, indexing, and links to that individual. It's a lot
of work. So many individuals (thousands) are on the web site but not yet profiled. I have intentionally
designed this web site with generic, static web pages so that search engines (like Google) can
easily index everyone on the web site. So when searching for a Shook, it is not unusual to find one
or more links to this web site.</p>

<p>When you click on an individual, the index will change to that individual's family line. If you
click on Hermanus Shook, for example, the &quot;The Shook Family&quot; index will change to the &quot;Hermanus
Shook&quot; index and everyone in that list will belong to the Hermanus Shook family. Note that some of the
individuals in the master index do not have their own family line (yet), and families are not
necessarily unrelated: I just merged two families.

<h1>The Johannes Schuck (Shook) Family</h1>

<p><a href="/shook/schuck_johannes_georg_der_elder.html">Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder</a>
immigrated from Germany to the United States of America in 1732. This is my family line, and, naturally, where I spend
most (but not all) of time researching. About 60% of my research is on this family. Johannes</p>

<h2>Josiah Webster Shook</h2>

<p>This research started with my Texas Shook family (Josiah Webster Shook) and our ancestor
Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder. Hence, my Shook tree is the following:
<a href="/shook/shook_jan_joseph_jr.html">Jan Joseph Shook, Jr.</a>-&gt;
<a href="/shook/shook_jan_joseph_sr.html">Jan Joseph Shook, Sr.</a>-&gt;

While this may uninteresting, it may help you follow the progression of research.</p>

<p>Josiah Webster Shook was born circa 1808 in North Carolina, and seems to have immigrated to Texas
in the late 1830's. In his will, Abraham Shook (North Carolina) records Josiah as his son. So far in
my research,  I have not been able to find another Josiah Shook. That is ties Josiah to an Abraham Shook
North Carolina. Unfortunately, there were two Abraham Shook families originating in North Carolina. Both
Abrahams were born within a generation of each other and documentation is scant. At this time, however, I
believe my line descends from the Abraham Shook born on 03-FEB-1764 and the other line descends from the
Abraham Shook born circa 1782. It the latter Abraham that is the son of Johanne Jacob Shook - a well
documented pioneer of North Carolina.</p>

<h2>Johanne Jacob Shook</h2>

<p>(My) Abraham Shook was Jacob's youngest brother. So my family line does not descend from
Johanne Jacob Shook. Still, he is an interesting character, and a great study in Shook history. I urge you to read <i>Greater Than
The Mountains Was He</i> by Wilma Hicks Simpson. Clicking on the book cover to the right takes
you to Amazon.com (I do not make a commission on any purchase). Wilma gives a good biography of
Johanne Jacob Shook; how his father (Johannes Georg &quot;Hans&quot; Schuck der Junger) and grandfather
(Johannes Georg Schuck der Elder) arrived in Pennsylvania from Germany; how his descendents immigrated
from Pennsylvania to North Carolina; and how Jacob Shook became immersed in Methodism.</p>

<h2>American History</h2>

<p>Wilma Hicks Simpson's book <i>Greater Than The Mountains Was He</i> provides a good overview
of the Shook family in American history (including Pennsylvania and North Carolina). On Ancestry.com,
the  maps below show the migration of all families with a surname of Shook from U.S. Federal Census
data for 1840, 1880, and 1920.</p>

<h2>Texas History</h2>
