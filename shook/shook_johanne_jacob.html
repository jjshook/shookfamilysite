<h1>Buried</h1>

<p>Jacob is buried at Pleasant Hill Cemetery in Clyde, Haywood County, North Carolina. This cemeter is old, historic, and 
quite beautiful. Graves are spread across rolling hills. There are quite a few Shook graves, as the cemetery sits on property 
donated by Jacob.</p>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>One of the best web sites about Shook History is <a href="http://www.shookhistory.org/main_site">shookhistory.org</a>.
This web site is dedicated to Johanne Jacob Shook.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2011, Jan J. Shook, Jr. and Jarret Alexander Shook stopped at the Shook-Smather's House on the way to driving Jarret to 
southern Methodist University (from New Jersey to Texas). We took quite a few pictures, but the museum was not open. We I picked up Jarret 
in the Spring, we stopped at the house/museum again. This time we had connected with Sharon Shook who opened up the house and spent an 
hour or so discussing the history of the house/museum. Everything I have collected about Jacob Shook is from the shookhistory.org web 
site. Sharon and I checked if there was any more information about Abraham. Unfortunately, while there has been extensive research on 
many of Jacob's children, the only piece of information regarding Abraham is his birthday.</p>
