<p>By 1830, <a href="https://shookfamilywebsite.z21.web.core.windows.net/morris/morris_amanda_elizabeth.html">Amanda Elizabeth (Morris) Shook</a>, the future
wife of <a href="https://shookfamilywebsite.z21.web.core.windows.net/shook/shook_josiah_webster.html">Josiah Webster Shook</a>, was about 9 years old. By the end
of the decade, Amanda would have been 19 years old and would have witnessed the Civil War (as it was known then) between Mexico and the
Texicans. I have read that Amanda was living on a farm near Lynch's Ferry (today known as Lynchburg) close to the final Battle of
San Jacinto in April 1836.</p>

<p>Josiah seems to have arrived in Texas shortly after the war, immigrating to the Republic of Texas sometime between 1837 and 1839
(although he could have arrived unrecorded a bit earlier). On 04-APR-1839, Josiah received a 3rd Class land grant from the Republic of
Texas. Hence, land, may have been the attraction for Josiah.</p>


<p>Currently, my research shows no other Shook families in Texas during the 1830s.</p>
