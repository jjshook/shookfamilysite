<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>Jacob Wright SHOOK (Jacob) was born on 29-JAN-1823 in Madison County, Missouri. He died in MAR-1882 in Florida.</p>

<p>Jacob Wright Shook was named as a son in Jacob Shook's will and he was bequeathed 1/5th of Jacob's estate. He is identified as a brother of Daniel, 
Jefferson and Nathan, and as a Methodist preacher, in the biographical sketch for Nathan found in &quot;Montgomery County Texas History.&quot; For some 
unknown reason, he decided to live and work primarily in northwest Arkansas. Traces of him are found in Benton, Marion, Madison, and Washington counties, 
as well as Saline County. An article in the November 23, 1849 issue of the Democrat newspaper told of the appointment of J. W. Shook to the Carrollton 
Circuit of the Arkansas M. E. Conference. He was performing marriages in Saline County in 1851. He lived in Benton County in 1860. He is identified in 
the census that year as a &quot;Methodist Clergyman&quot; who was born in Missouri. An article in &quot;Marion County Churches&quot; by Mrs. Bernice Johnson 
states: &quot;Mr. T. J. Estes in Early Days and War Times in North Arkansas tells of Parson J. H. Wade coming to Yellville and holding a meeting in a brush 
arbor. (This was probably after the burning of the church building when he re-organized the Methodist work in this area.) There were around one hundred 
confessions. He was assisted in these meetings by Parsons Shinn and Shook, two more of the pioneer preachers.&quot; An article in the Goodspeed Publishing 
Company's 1889 &quot;History of Benton, Washington, Carroll, Madison, Crawford, Franklin, and Sebastian Counties, Arkansas&quot; states that the Huntsville 
territory of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South was reorganized immediately after the Civil War by Reverend Jacob Shook. He lived in Washington County 
in 1870. He is identified in the census that year as a farmer and his real estate and personal property was valued at $2300.</p>

<p>The following memorial was transcribed by Vivian W. Andrew from the notes of the November 15-20, 1882 Arkansas M.E. Conference held at Bentonville, 
Arkansas. &quot;Jacob W. Shook was born in Madison County, Missouri, January 29, 1823. At seven years of age his father and family moved to Hempstead County, 
Arkansas, where he grew up to manhood. He joined the M.E. Church as a seeker of religion at fourteen years of age, and in a few months afterward embraced 
and publicly professed religion. He was admitted on trial in the Arkansas Annual Conference, M.E. Church, in 1845, and remained effective until the conference 
of 1869, at Fayetteville, when he located and remained thus for three years. In 1872 he was readmitted, and five years afterward became supernumerary at the 
Fayetteville Conference of 1877, and was continued in this relation until the Conference of 1880, at Fort Smith, when he was appointed to the Illinois Circuit, 
and in August of 1881 was compelled by failing health to desist from active labor, having in April of that year undergone the deep sorrow of losing by death 
his devoted and estimable wife, whose maiden name was Sarah Hulsey, to whom he was married March 24, 1853.</p>

<p>In March of 1882 he went to Florida hoping to recuperate his health, but was attacked by pleurisy, and after a painful illness of several days, attended 
by one of his sons, he closed his ministry on earth, and was called, we doubt not, to a bright reward on high, leaving two sons, with their families, and the 
Church to mourn his loss. His ministry ran through a term of nearly thirty-seven years, during which time he was recognized by all who knew him as a humble, 
devoted man of God, true to the Church, and full of faith and the Holy Ghost. The absence of proper data forbids furnishing the various appointments he filled 
in the Conference. Suffice it to say he filled a number of important appointments - was chosen immediately after the war to come west, as presiding elder of 
the Fayetteville District, and reorganize as best he could our scattered flocks, many of whose homes had been laid desolate in ashes by the sad fortunes of war. 
A man of God has fallen from our ranks whose soul was fired with love to God and man, whose preaching was often in demonstration of the Spirit and in power. 
Let us gird up our loins, and press on to meet and greet him on the bright celestial shores.&quot;</p>
