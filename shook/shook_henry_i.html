<h1>Death Notice (Joseph Johnson)</h1>

<p>An old resident of this country, breathed his last at his home in north Egypt last Sunday morning at about
three o'clock. Mr. Shook was somewhere near seventy-five years of age, and was very feeble. He had been failing
in health for several months, but was confined to his bed only about one day preceding his death.</p>

<p>His body was interred in the Frans cemetery last Monday at three o'clock, p.m. A large number of friends and
sympathizers followed the remains to their last resting place. His daughter Mrs. Johnson, of Coulee City, arrived
a few minutes before the remains were taken from the house. The services were conducted by Mr. Bowers, of Egypt</p>
