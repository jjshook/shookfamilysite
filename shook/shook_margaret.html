<h1>Story</h1>

<p>The Margaret Shook Story</p>
<p>Contributed by Wilma Hicks Simpson and Doralyn Hicks Short</p>

<p>Margaret Shook was born 04 June 1793 in Haywood Co., NC, the daughter of
Jacob Shook and Isabella Weitzel. On 20 November 1817 she married Joseph
Hicks, the son of a neighbor and fellow farmer, Jonathan Hicks. The new
couple lived and reared their children on their own hundred and forty-acre
farm in Haywood County. They had seven children, four daughters and three
sons. When Jacob Shook's personal property was sold after his death in
1839, Joseph Hicks purchased household furniture from the Shook estate.
Joseph Hicks died sometime prior to 1850. We find in the Haywood County,
NC. Courthouse Archives in Record of Deeds Book F, on pages 417 and 418 a
record of Divestiture of Land by Coroner. The sale of Joseph Hicks' one
hundred and forty acres of abandoned land was to pay debts and to clear
the title of said land.</p>

<p>By 1850 Margaret was living with her unmarried children in Cherokee
County, Alabama. Her nephew W.T. Shook, son of Peter Shook, had been
appointed her guardian. We have 1850 census for Cherokee County, District
27, taken 7 Jan 1851, page 117 family # 777 showing Margaret, widowed head
of household. Included in her household are Jacob, Elizabeth, Calloway,
and Margaret. Also in District 27, page 68 family # 434 is listed the
family of William T. Shook, a cabinet maker from North Carolina.
According to the History of Craighead County Arkansas by Harry Lee
Williams, 1930, page 410, in 1852, 13 families left Cherokee County
Alabama in a wagon train headed for the Crowley Ridge area of North East
Arkansas, to a settlement called Greensboro. These pioneer families
settled here, carved homesteads, intermarried, and became steadfast
citizens of the area. Their descendants are there to this day. At least
five of these families included Margaret and her children; the remaining
families were related to the spouses of those children.</p>

<p>A Marker is all that remains today of Craighead County's first settlement
The government had opened this land for Military Bounty Location Warrants.
Margaret Hicks, as mother and heir at law of Jonathan Hicks, deceased,
fifer in Captain Thomason's Company Regiment, Alabama Vol., had been given
Warrant # 72417. This is recorded in Craighead County's Deed Book 33 page
97 and in the US General Land Office Volume 139, page 204. This 162.5
acres became a portion of what came to be known as the Hicks Homestead. At
this time, this property was in Greene County. When Craighead County was
formed the county line divided the Hicks property and a portion of this
land was located in Craighead County. Margaret's younger son, Calloway,
made his home on the Craighead County property while Margaret and the
elder son, Jacob, eventually lived on the remainder of the estate in
Greene County. Apparently not all the men who came to Greensboro from
Alabama in 1852 to purchase land immediately moved their families to the
new frontier; Jacob and his mother, Margaret, being one of these families.
Margaret's daughter, Mahalia, had married Jarrel J. Dacus and Margaret
deeded four acres of her land to them. Jarrel J. Dacus's family had been
on the wagon train from Alabama. Margaret Davis, who became Calloway's
wife, was also on this wagon train with her sister and brother-in-law
Frances Armanda Davis Kitchens and James H. Kitchens.</p>

<p> That Jacob Shook's involvement with the Methodist Church exerted a strong
influence in Margaret's and her descendants' lives there can be no doubt.
Although only two sons can be directly proven to be the children of
Jonathan Hicks, father of Joseph, he reared a large family. Census records
show several younger Hicks men living near him on the Buncombe/Haywood
County line during the early part of the nineteenth century. Some of these
men and their descendants became Methodist ministers as did descendants of
Jacob. It seems significant that Margaret Shook and Joseph Hicks married
in the month of November. Perhaps the two of them met and courted on the
grounds behind Louisa Chapel during the Methodist Camp Meeting that year.
There was no Methodist Church nearby when the Hicks family relocated to
the Arkansas frontier but still the children were reared as devout
Methodists. Margaret's grandson, James Ransom Hicks was a Steward in the
first Methodist Church organized close to him in Burnt Hill.</p>

<p>Calloway Hicks, James Ransom Hicks and George David Hicks:
Son, grandson and great-grandson of Margaret Shook Hicks.
Margaret Shook Hicks died between 1870 and 1880; probably around 1877. We
believe that she is buried in the Rutherford Cemetery in Craighead County
in an unmarked grave. This cemetery is located about two miles from the
Hicks' land. It is one of the two oldest cemeteries in the county and
contains the graves of many of the early pioneers. The Dacus' of the wagon
train are here. Calloway's wife, Margaret Davis Hicks, is buried there and
her grave is marked. There are several unmarked and marked graves of
allied families in this area. After Margaret's death, Jacob moved to Logan
County AR where he died in 1893. He is buried in Antioch Cemetery in a
grave marked only with a heap of stones.</p>

<p>The 1870 census is the last where Calloway is found. In 1880, Margaret
Davis Hicks is shown as widowed, head of household. Land Records show that
Calloway's land was divided among his son and five daughters by late 1882.
We believe he may also be buried in an unmarked grave, along with his
mother and near his wife, in the Rutherford Cemetery.</p>

<p>Grave of Margaret Davis Hicks, wife of Calloway Hicks in Rutherford
Cemetery. This grave is in the center of one of the oldest cemeteries in
Craighead County. Other Hicks family members are believed to be buried in
the unmarked sites surrounding her grave.</p>

<p>The lay of the land where Margaret Shook Hicks came to live in Arkansas is
hilly country. It is one beautiful rolling knoll after another. It must
have looked much like her beloved countryside in Haywood County, NC. We
wonder how she missed her old home, the place of her birth, the home of
her father, mother and siblings. By now most of her siblings had migrated
south and west, as she did. One never forgets the place of their birth.
Was she homesick often? Were there occasional letters from her siblings?
There is so much we long to know about her. What we do know now is only a
drop in a pond of what we do not yet know, what we can never know.</p>
