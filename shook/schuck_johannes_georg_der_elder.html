<h1 class="first">Family Line</h1>

<p>Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder-&gt;
<a href="/shook/schuck_wilhem_ludwig.html">Wilhem Ludwig Schuck</a> (f)-&gt;
<a href="/shook/schuck_hans_peter.html">Hans Peter Schuck</a> (gf)-&gt;
<a href="/shook/schuck_daniel.html">Daniel Schuck</a> (g-gf).</p>

<p>Note that I have indexed this family as Johannes Schuck. Wilhem Ludwig Schuck (his father) and
Hans Peter Schuck (his grandfather) are recent discoveries and not source properly yet. Given that it
was Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder that immigrated to the United States of America, I am inclined
to keep Johannes as the head of the American Schuck (Shook) family for now.</p>

<h1>Surname</h1>

<p>Recorded documents show Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder (John George Shook, Sr.) retained
his German surname Schuck after arriving in the United States of America (1732). His son, Johannes Georg
&quot;Hans&quot; Schuck, der Junger (John George &quot;Hans&quot; Shook, Jr.) retained his German 
surname Schuck as well. His grandchildren were the first to     their surname to Shook. Note
that the suffix &quot;der Elder&quot; is equivalent to &quot;Senior&quot; in English.</p>

<h1>Given Name</h1>

<p>Johannes Georg is spelled with the 'e' left off (the German way) as Georg. In English, the 'e' is appended
and spelled the way we are familiar with in the United States of America; that is, George.</p>

<h1>Marriage</h1>

<p>Anna Maria WHITTER; born: 1697 in Germany; died: 23-JAN-1772 in Williams Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania;
buried: [Probably] Saint Lukes Old Williams Cemetery, Northampton County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<h1>Immigration</h1>

<p>Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder arrived in the United States of America on 17-OCT-1732. He
landed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on the ship &quot;John & William&quot; via Rotterdam accompanied
by his wife, Anna Maria Whitter, and his two children Christina Dorothea Schuck and Marie Catherina
Schuck. Rosina Barbara Schuck is not listed on the ship's manifest. After entering Philidelphia, Johannes
and his family traveled up the Deleware River and settled in the Williams Township area of Northampton
County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<h1>History</h1>

<p>Johannes settled in the Williams Township area of Northampton County, Pennsylvania and remained there
until his death. He and Anna Marie (Whitter) Schuck were members of the Old Williams Township Evangelical
Lutheran Church (or Saint Luke's) near Hellertown, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. I live in New Jersey,
and the church and its cemetery are only about an hour and half from my house. I've visisted the cemetery
quite a few times. It's a beautiful area. There is a lot more history to describe here. I'm working on it ...</p>

<h1>Last Will and Testament of Johannes Schuck</h1>

<p>The fourth day of July in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three, I John

<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>This research began with the ShookHistory.org web site (unfortunately, now defunct). Much of that work
made its way into the novel <i>Greater Than The Mountain Was He</i> by Wilma Hicks Simpson. Using those sources
of information, Johannes was the termination of this family line until recently. Research by Michael Eugene
Reynolds, however, has really enhanced the profile of Johannes Georg Schuck, der Elder. Michael is the husband
of my 4th cousin (Frances Ann (Stewart) Reynolds). He did his research at the Dallas Public Library. He also
worked with a genealogist familiar with German history. I do not have sources for this information (yet).</p>
