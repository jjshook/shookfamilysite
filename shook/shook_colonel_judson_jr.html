<h1>Obituary (Elaine)</h1>

<p>Elaine Claire Smith Shook, 86, born March 18, 1926, to David and Mathilda "Tillie" Smith in Cape Girardeau, MO,
passed away peacefully of respiratory failure on April 26, 2012, at her residence in Richardson, with her daughter
Lela by her side. Elaine was preceded in death on April 24, 2010, by her husband of 62 years, LT COL C. Judson Shook, Jr.,
three-time war veteran, recipient of Bronze Star medal, and former Director of Transportation for the City of Richardson
and Director of Public Works for Dallas County, during which time he was responsible for salvaging the Texas School Book
Depository for Dallas County, which is now the Sixth Floor Museum. Elaine and Judson spent part of their childhoods in
DeRidder, Louisiana, and were high school sweethearts and fellow cheerleaders at DeRidder High School, marrying after he
graduated from the US Naval Academy in August 1948. She was great friends with her future mother-in-law, Lela Frazar Bourgeois,
who owned the town boutique and was instrumental in their courtship, knowing what a beautiful, charming, and intelligent
wife Elaine would make for her son. She devotedly served our nation as a Navy and Air Force officer's wife until Judson
retired in 1969 to become Director of Public Works for Dallas County, enduring with grace the many uprootings and relocations
for Judson's reassignments. No matter where they were stationed, she showed her love for her family by creating a beautiful
home. She demonstrated her great strength and determination by raising their son and daughter alone while Judson was deployed
overseas to serve in the Korean War while he was in the US Navy, and in the Vietnam War after his transfer to the US Air Force.
Her father was a respected dairy farmer in Oklahoma and Louisiana. She lost her sweet mother, Tillie, when she was 23, before
her children were born. They were life-long Methodists, although she was proud of her father's rich Mennonite heritage. She was
the second youngest of five siblings, and is survived by her younger brother, Warren Smith, of Duncanville, TX, who was also
Judson's best friend. Brothers, Dr. Irving Smith and Dr. Norman Smith, and sister, Ruby Smith Bennett, preceded her in death.
The Smith children were highly intelligent, well educated, accomplished in music, and collectively raised 15 Smith descendants.
She cherished her brothers and sister, and loved to sing with them at family gatherings. Elaine graduated ('47) with high
distinction from The Southwestern Louisiana Institute of Liberal and Technical Learning, Lafayette, LA, with a BA in music. A
gifted vocalist and choir director, she also played viola. She graduated with the highest scholastic average in Iota Omicron
Chapter of Sigma Alpha Iota, and was a published poet and a &quot;Who's Who in American Colleges.&quot; Her love of music and
education led her to teach junior high school music while the family was stationed in Taipei, Taiwan, and Bossier City, LA. Later,
she sold real estate in Dallas and was employed in the library at St. Mark's School of Texas. She loved art, film, theater, reading,
bridge, and traveling the world with their close friends, the Blairs and Joneses. She was highly creative in many artistic pursuits,
such as painting, flower arranging, home decorating, and sewing beautiful garments and home accessories for herself and daughter
Lela, and costumes for her grandchildren. Elaine is survived by her son, Jeffry Stewart Shook, and wife Jeannine Shook, of Charlotte,
NC; and her daughter Lela Shook Paksoy, and husband Dr. HB Paksoy, of Richardson, TX. Grandchildren: Valerie Shook Barclay, and
husband Christopher Barclay, St. Louis, MO; Adam Lee Shook, and wife Holly Shook, Dallas, TX; and Catherine Elayne Morrow Vaughan
and husband Jacob Vaughan, Plano, TX. Great-grandchildren: Maren Barclay and Graeme Barclay, St. Louis, MO; and Josiah Shook, Elisbeth
Shook, and Jonathan Shook, Dallas, TX. In accordance with Judson and Elaine's expressed request, Jeff and Lela will transport their
parents' cremains to Woodlawn Cemetery, DeRidder, LA, for burial. Also following Elaine's wishes, a private family memorial service
celebrating her life will be held when all the children and grandchildren can gather next in Dallas, TX.</p>
