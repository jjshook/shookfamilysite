<h1>Stories</h1>

<p>John Wesley SHOOK was born about 1847 in Texas.</p>

<p>The following biographical sketch of John Wesley Shook and Cynthia Jane Lewis and their family was written by their granddaughter Vivian W. Andrew for 
&quot;Coryell County Families.&quot; The sketch is entitled SHOOK-LEWIS and includes a photograph of the family which was taken in 1897.</p>

<p>&quot;The John Wesley Shook family of Pearl counted the Robinson, Lewis and Peden names in its background. First to come to Texas was the Robinson family, 
in 1829. Laureno Robinson married Nathan Shook, a Methodist preacher, in 1842, and John Wesley (1846-1921) was the youngest of their three sons. He grew up in 
the Robinson home, and was a boy of eight when they moved from Walker to Coryell County in 1854.</p>

<p>Cynthia Jane Lewis was born near Rome, Georgia, and came to Texas in 1849 at age six. The family lived in Cherokee, then Freestone, before coming to Coryell 
County. Jane was a teenager during the Civil War and lost a brother in a northern prison camp. One story handed down was how she carried her shoes until she got 
almost to church, then put them on. She and John Wesley were married in 1869 and lived happily together until her death in 1912.</p>

<p>In 1875 the family moved from Owl Creek to western Coryell County. The cove near Live Oak Gap stayed in the Shook family until 1952, and descendants still 
made sentimental trips there to see &quot;our old tree.&quot;</p>

<p>John Shook had diversified talents: carpenter, farmer, rancher, and harvester. His account book lists many families for whom he cut grain. However, his 
real love was the ministry. He was a licensed local preacher, and did mostly supply work. Jane also had a strong Methodist background and the Pearl Methodist 
Church was organized in their home.</p>

<p>Seven children survived to adulthood. Joshua (1871-1927) married Sarah Cox; their children: Frankie, Frieda, Lucian, Lorraine, Leon, J. H., Clarence, and 
Jack. Clarence (1873-1951) and Ida Williamson were married in 1895 and had two children: Ouida, who married Dan Jones, and Gordon, who married Myra Merle Adams 
of Meridian. Carrie (1874-1962) married Wesley Cooper in 1879 [sic]. Their children were Gladys, Gladyne, Garland, and Graydon. Bessie (1876-1966) and Will 
(1880-1952) never married. Mary Ted (1882-1974) married Will Andrew and had seven offspring: Shook, Shannon, Dorothy, Vivian, W.G., Katherine, and Winifred. 
John Wesley Jr. "Dick" (1884-1962) married Etta Roberts. Roger and Shirley were their children.</p>

<p>Clarence, "C. J." Shook spent most of his life in the Pearl community. He ran a grocery store, bought cotton, hunted Indian artifacts, and led the singing at 
the Methodist Church. Will stayed on the farm until his death in 1952, exerting his quiet, steady influence in the community. From 1927 Ted and her orphans lived 
with him. Bessie began teaching in her teens, riding horseback across the &quot;mountains&quot; to her first school. Her long and distinguished career as an English 
teacher ended after World War II. The three other children also left the county. Josh is buried in Stephensville, Carrie in the Pearl Cemetery, and Dick in Bentonville, 
Arkansas, where he retired after long residence in Canyon, Texas.</p>

<p>The family is still represented in Pearl, in 1984, by Mrs. Myra Shook and Mrs. Dorothy Andrew Carroll.</p>

<p>The following biographical sketch of John Wesley Shook was also written by his granddaughter Vivian W. Andrew and was extracted from "Vignettes Of Coryell County" 
by Claude and Mabel Bailry, 1976. Those who reported incidents in the life of John Wesley were his daughters, Miss Bessie Shook and Mary T. Shook Andrew, and a granddaughter, 
Mrs. Quida Shook Jones.</p>

<p>&quot;J. W. Shook (1846-1921) was the third son of Nathan and Lorena Robinson Shook. Nathan was a minister and surveyor, and when a party organized to go to California at 
the time of the Gold Rush, he went along as a surveyor and left Lorena with her father. Nathan married Lorena in 1842 and she bore him four children before he went away in 
1849. John Wesley was one of the children. &quot;So far as my grandmother knew, not one of the party was ever heard from again. any of the wagon trains were demolished by 
Indians,&quot; said Mary T. Andrew in July 1969.</p>

<p>1869 John Wesley married Cynthia Jane Lewis (1843-1912) a native of Georgia who was the daughter of Lotspeich and Elizabeth Jane Lewis of Oglesby ...</p>

<p>When John Wesley and Jane moved to Pearl in 1875, Lorena went along and made her home with them. After reaching the frontier at Pearl, the Shooks offered their home for 
the organization of a Methodist Church. Among the charter members were Grandpa's sister, Mary and her husband W. G. Davenport ...</p>

<p>In 1887 Grandpa was licensed to preach, and in 1892 at Waco he was ordained a local deacon. Except for part of one year, he did only local ministerial work, but he loved to 
preach, and as long as he was physically able to had appointments at needy places near home.</p>

<p>Quoting from Aunt Bess in Grandpa's obituary: &quot;No man loved the great hymns of the church more than Father did. He loved to sing them, and he knew dozens of them. 
As a child, I used to go with him to the market twenty-five miles away, and he would frequently sing hymns all the way along the country road.&quot;</p>

<p>The ministers who served the early rural churches traveled from community to community on horseback, carrying a Bible, a tuning fork, and a hymn book. This writer has seen 
the hymn book that was carried by John Wesley Shook, and it was hand written. No group of people is entitled to more praise than the circuit rider. With a gun in one hand and a 
Bible in the other, he brought comfort and cheer to many lonely men and women. (Mears, Scrapbook of Coryell County.)</p>

<p>Although preaching was Grandpa's great love, there was a living to be earned for a growing family. He farmed, tried his hand at raising cattle, was a fair carpenter, and by 
1886 owned a reaper for the use of which he had a respectable list of clients. Tradition has it that he erected the second barbed-wire fence in the county.</p>

<p>Religious training came naturally in the Shook family. Aunt Bess recalled that each morning the family rose, dressed and had morning prayer -- &quot;to feed the spirit before 
the body.&quot; My mother added that sometimes Grandpa would get carried away by his own eloquence and Grandma would say, &quot;Hurry it up, John Wesley, my biscuits will burn!&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Clarence (Quida's father) remembered when Grandpa came back in the house one late evening after he had checked on his stock at the barn, threw his gun on the table and said, 
&quot;This is the last time I am going to carry a gun. I think we are peaceful enough that no gun-toting is necessary.&quot; And he kept his word.</p>

<p>Another story Quida remembers was when there were a number of &quot;outlaws&quot; around Evant who were causing trouble. Some of the Evant citizens and perhaps an officer of the 
law chased one man over Live Oak Gap and down, and caught him just south of Grandpa's house. They had a rope and were about to hang the man from one of the oak trees close to the house. 
Grandpa walked out and told them that he was a peace loving man and that there would be no violence on his property. He convinced them enough that they left. Quida did not know if they 
finally hanged the man or not.</p>

<p>But some events even his forceful personality could not affect. A postcard was found addressed to Clarence and bearing the following message:</p>

<p>Dallas, April 3, 1912</p>

<p>Dear Clarence,</p>

<p>We are here at Peacock Hotel, 1922 1/2 Elm St.; got here at 9:30 o'clock last night. Just got back from the Doctor. He thinks he will make a final cure this time.</p>

<p>J. W. Shook</p>

<p>But, his Jane died April 22, before he got her back home.</p>

<p>J. W. Shook was the grandfather of Gordon Shook of Pearl.</p>

<p>Finally, the following paragraph relating the history of the Pearl Methodist Church was extracted from &quot;Historical Markers In Coryell County.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A group of Methodist gathered in the home of the Rev. John Wesley Shook (1846-1921) in the winter 1875-76 to organize a congregation. Early worship services 
were held in the Hope Schoolhuse. In 1890 landowner Charley Karnes (1854-1933) gave the Methodist Church three acres of land on which to build a sanctuary. By 1892 a 
Sunday school was in operation, and in 1900 a Parsonage was built near the Church. The existing sanctuary was erected about 1919-20, and the Parsonage was sold in 1953. 
Serving the people of a large area, the size of the Church's membership varied over the years. As the population of surrounding communities began to grow, members of 
Pearl Methodist Church withdrew to help organize new congregations. In October 1975 the Church celebrated its centennial with a special program involving descendants 
of J. W. Shook and other early members. Four years later, in March 1979, the congregation voted to disband and the Church was officially discontinued by the Methodist 
Denomination. The Church property was given to the Pearl Cemetery Association in 1985. Pearl Methodist Church stands as a reminder of the area's early heritage.&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth SHOOK (Jacob) was born in 1815/1820 in Missouri Territory.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Pearce was named a daughter and identified as &quot;formerly Elizabeth Shook&quot; by Jacob Shook in his will. She was bequeathed 1/5th of his estate. 
In 1850 she lived in Franklin Parish in Louisiana. Her husband died that year and she returned to Arkansas. In 1860 she was a farmer in Ouachita County with real and 
personal property valued at $3,390.</p>

<p>Elizabeth married (1) P. L. SMITH on 03-JAN-1836 in Hempstead County, Arkansas.</p>

<p>Elizabeth also married (2) John Harris PEARCE2, son of Benjamin Franklin PEARCE and Selah Celia) HARRIS, in 1842 in Union County, Arkansas. John was born on 18 Oct 1796 
in Georgia. He died on 8 Dec 1850 in Franklin Parrish, Louisiana.</p>

<p>John Harris Pearce was married twice before his marriage to Elizabeth. His first marriage was to Mary Robertson Tooke, daughter of William Tooke and Mary Gatlin, on May 23, 1823 
in Pulaski County, Georgia. They had five children; Edmund Jackson Pearce (1828), Sarah Gatlin Pearce (1829), Rebecca Ann Pearce (1832), William Tooke Pearce (1833), and Benjamin Franklin 
Pearce (1835). Edmund died after a duel with M. P. Dailey, his wife's sister's husband. Sarah helped raise her half-sister Paralee after the death of their father. His second marriage 
was to Millie Neals in Lowndes County, Alabama in 1837.</p>
