children that she adored and loved.</p>

also preceded in death by her mother Evelyn Davis Wilkerson</p>

<p>She leaves to cherish her memory husband Jeff Vienneau; daughter Melissa Shook;
grandson Matthew Shook; son Jeffery Vienneau; and father Orville Wilkerson.</p>

<p>The family will receive friends from 12:00 PM (Noon) to 2:00 PM on Monday, February
