<h1>Given Name</h1>

<p>My apologies to my late father-in-law. I had his middle name recorded as James for a long time, and my wife (after at least 10 years)
finally picked up on the incorrect given name. Bob's correct middle name was Joseph (not James). I knew Bob for over 20 years. The only names
ever used for him were Bob, Dad, and Grandpa Bob.</p>

<h1>Obiturary</h1>

<p>Robert (Bob) Corsiglia, age 72, of Munster, IN, passed away peacefully on Tuesday, December 25, 2007, with his wife Emilie and his family 
by his side. He courageously battled cancer for three and a half years. He is survived by his loving wife of 20 years Emilie; son Thomas (Candy); 
daughter Nancee (Mark) Tomassoni; daughter Karen (Jan) Shook; first wife Patricia Smith; brothers Richard and John and seven grandchildren. Bob 
was born on January 21, 1935 in the Ausin neighborhood of Chicago. He graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science 
degree in Electrical Engineering. He held a professional engineering license in nine states. He was a member of the IIT President's Council and 
Vice-president of Administration of the Illinois Institute of Technology Alumni Board. Bob was the CEO and President of EMCOR Hyre Electric Co. 
of Indiana, and it's predecessor companies for more than 35 years. Bob was the guiding force behind Hyre, strengthening and building it to one 
of the largest electrical contracting companies in NWI. More importantly, he provided many employees an opportunity to advance their formal education 
and position within the company. His compassion and understanding have helped many achieve goals far beyond their expectations. Bob retired from Hyre 
in 2005, passing along his dedication to the business, family and the family of Hyre Electric, to his son Thomas and daughter Nancee who will carry 
on the tradition of running a successful organization. Bob served as Chairman of the Western Division of the National Electrical Contractors Association 
of Northwest Indiana for 15 years. During that time, he served on many committees, including the NECA/IBEW Local 697 Labor Management committee and 
the NECA/IBEW Apprentice committee. He was instrumental in selecting and guiding hundreds of young apprentices who today carry on the tradition of 
integrity and dedication to hard work, values that continue today with the union members of Local 697. Bob's proudest accomplishment was being trustee
 of many of the IBEW/NECA Multi-Employer Trusts for more than 30 years. He was instrumental in strengthening the Pension Trust, Health and Welfare 
Benefit Trust and Money Purchase Trust. These trusts provide health and retirement benefits to Local 697 union electricians. Bob was very dedicated 
to the community and has served as Director of the Northwest Indiana United Way, Director and Vice-president of the Northern Indiana Arts Association, 
and he was a member of the Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America. Bob loved to travel and recently completed a home in Florida, where he wanted 
to retire with his wife. He loved spending time with his herb garden and orchids, watering and pruning. He proudly displayed his flowers. He was an avid 
reader, always looking to learn something new. Bob will be greatly missed by his loving family and many friends. A memorial service will be held Saturday, 
December 29, 2007 from 11:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. at Kish Funeral Home, 10000 Calumet Ave., Munster, IN. Memorial contributions to Hospice of the Calumet 
Area in Robert's memory will be appreciated. More information please call 219-924-3333.<p>
