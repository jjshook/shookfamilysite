<h1>Notes</h1>

<p>The February 1, 1875 marriage of Oscar Neidigk to Elizabeth Eule is probably the marriage
of Oscar Charles Neidigk to Elizabeth Winkler. The timing is about right. Fred Neidigk was born
~9 months later on November 28, 1875. oscar immigrated from Germany to the United States on
18-NOV-1867. He was 18 years old.</p>

<h1>Story</h1>

<p>Determined to Die</p>

<p>Charles Neidigk, With Two Knives at Hand, Shoots Himself.</p>

<p>Oscar Charles Neidigk, a well-to-do German, 44 years old, committed suicide by shooting himself in the right temple at his
boarding house, 3720 Cozens avenue, at 6 o'clock yesterday morning. Mrs. Christine Meinhardt, with whom he boarded, heard the shot
and, hurrying to his room, knocked on the door. Receiving no answer she looked through a window and saw Neidigk sitting on a chair
in front of a mirror bleeding from a wound in his head. She notified officers Rhodeman and Dreos, who took charge of the room and
sent the body to the Morgue. On the dresser in front of the suicide lay a large, old-fashioned dirk, while the left hand of the
corpse clutched a large jack-knife. There was only one shell in the revolver. The knives were evidently for use in case the bullet
did not prove fatal. Neidigk some time ago told Mrs. Meinhardt that he was suffering greatly from dropsy and that if that if he did
not get well he would end his existence. A year ago he told her he considerable property in Texas near a railway, and that the
railway would have to buy the land some day. When Neidigk's body was searched $297 was found in one of his pockets. In a trunk
$1,180 was found. The money consisted of one $500 bill and the rest in $20 bills. From a note book found in the room containing a lot
of drawings of keys it is thought that Neidigk owns a patent of some kind or had been working on a patent. He came here two and a
half years ago from Texas, at some place near Galveston, where he worked in a sawmill. Mrs. Meinhardt says that once he told that he
had a divorced wife. Neidigk has a sister in Germany. Deputy Coroner Albers held an inquest and returned a verdict of suicide.</p>
